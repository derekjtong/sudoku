        Recognized globally as a classic puzzle game, Sudoku challenges you to fill a 9x9 grid with numbers in such a way that each row,

        cognitive abilities. Dive into the world of Sudoku and enjoy the thrill of puzzle-solving!
        <h1 className="py-4 text-2xl">Discover Sudoku</h1>
        Sudoku, a well-loved puzzle originating from Japan, revolves around strategically placing numbers. It&apos;s a game of logic that
        doesn&apos;t rely on mathematical calculations but rather on sharp thinking and concentration.
        <h1 className="py-4 text-2xl">Sudoku Gameplay Instructions</h1>
        The objective in Sudoku is to populate a 9x9 grid so that every row, column, and 3x3 section features the numbers 1 through 9,
        without repetition. Initially, some numbers are already placed in the grid, and your task is to fill in the blanks logically.
        Remember, a move is incorrect if:
        <ul className="list-disc pl-8">
          <li>A row has duplicates of any number from 1 to 9</li>
          <li>A column has duplicates of any number from 1 to 9</li>
          <li>A 3x3 grid has duplicates of any number from 1 to 9</li>
        </ul>
        <h1 className="py-4 text-2xl">Tips for Sudoku Beginners</h1>
        Sudoku can be immensely satisfying once you grasp its basics. For beginners, it might seem daunting at first. Here are some
        strategies to build your Sudoku skills:
        <ul className="list-disc pl-8">
          <li>
            Start by focusing on rows, columns, or 3x3 sections with at least five numbers. Analyze the missing numbers and try to deduce
            their rightful places by process of elimination.
          </li>
          <li>
            Visualize the grid in terms of 3 large columns and 3 rows, each containing 3x3 grids. If you spot a number repeated twice in any
            large column or row, the third instance of that number must be in the remaining 9-cell section. This can help you pinpoint the
            missing number&apos;s location.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Now that you&apos;re equipped with some basic knowledge about Sudoku, go ahead and challenge yourself with this engaging online
        game.
